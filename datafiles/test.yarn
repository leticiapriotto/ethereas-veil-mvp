Neriah: Sometimes, the paths we choose... lead us to places we never imagined.
Neriah: I used to believe that control was in my hands...
Neriah: ...until one night, the darkness itself spoke back to me.
Neriah: You hear those voices too, don't you?
Neriah: Voices that challenge us to confront what we'd rather hide?

Player: ...
Player: This... darkness... did you bring it upon yourself, or did it come to you?

Neriah: Ah... You know how it is. Sometimes, the abyss stares back, doesn't it?
Neriah: And when you see yourself reflected there, there's nothing left but to accept... or to lose yourself.
Neriah: You wouldn't understand... the pain of remembering what you'd rather forget.

Player: ... 
Player: I... understand more than you think. Not all memories are welcome. But sometimes, they're all we have left.

Neriah: Is that so? And if all that remains are scars?
Neriah: Marks of something that can't be erased... or redeemed.
Neriah: Would you still cling to it, to something that only brings pain?

Player: Maybe pain is... necessary.
Player: Perhaps it's what keeps us alert, reminds us of who we are... 
Player: or what we try to avoid.

The Death tarot card is often misunderstood and feared, primarily due to its name. However, in the upright position, this card signifies not physical death but rather a profound transformation. It represents the end of a significant phase in your life that you recognize is no longer serving you.
